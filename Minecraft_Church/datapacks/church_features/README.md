# Howell First United Methodist Church Features

## Spawn Point Feature

This datapack sets up the world spawn point at the church location.

### Usage

To set the spawn point, run this command in-game or in the server console:
```
/function church:set_spawn
```

- Change `0 100 0` to your desired X, Y, Z coordinates where the church entrance is located
- The Y coordinate should be the ground level (typically between 64-100)

### Future Features (To be implemented)
